\section{Course Description:}
This course is an introduction to elementary particle physics, the description of Nature at the shortest distance scales. 
This class will emphasize the theoretical underpinnings of the Standard Model of particle physics and its experimental verification.
The first part of the course will focus on the implications of combining Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity.
This union turns out to incredibly restrict the types of theories and particle interactions allowed.
In the second part of the course we will focus on the experimental methods for measuring elementary particle interactions and highlight the structure of the Standard Model.
With this introduction, we will survey various areas of active research including: the study of the Higgs boson, neutrino mixing, and the physics of flavor. 
Emphasis will be placed on what we do and do not know now and what we might know in 30 years.

\section{References:}
The material for this course will be largely based on my  notes, which I will make available on the course webpage. 
The course textbook is:
Andrew Larkoski, ``Elementary Particle Physics: An Intuitive Introduction'', Cambridge, 2019,
and will be used for some background reading and assignments. 

It is often helpful in this subject to get other points of view.  
I have found the following books useful.

\newpage

\section{Course Requirements:}
There will be three graded aspects of this course: $\sim$weekly homework problems and two in-class exams.
In calculating your final grade, your lowest homework score will be dropped.
Homework will develop methods discussed in lecture or flesh out sketches of arguments and unproven claims made in class.
Late homework can not be accepted.

\section{Grading:} 
The amounts to which the homework, mid-term and final exam contributes to your grade are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
Homework & 40\%\\
Mid-term Exam & 20\%\\
Final Exam & 40\%\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Homework Collaboration Policy:} 

Speak to each other!
You often learn just as effectively through discussion with your peers as you do from lecture. 
However, all homework you submit should be written individually and independently by you.
When it comes to discussing homework, any records of the discussion must be destroyed before you make any kind of write-up. 
If you have collaborated with anyone then you should declare who you worked with and the nature of your discussion. 
\textit{(Think citation for a publication)}
You will not be penalized for \underline{declared} homework collaboration. 
Undeclared collaboration is plagiarism and is considered cheating. 
All the work you submit should be your own work and reflect your understanding.
