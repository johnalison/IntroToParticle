\textbf{X) What are three major consequences of combining QM and Relativity?}\hfill \textit{(3 points)}\\

\textbf{X)  GZK cutoff energy} \hfill \textit{(5 points)}\\
High-energy cosmic rays (high energy protons), lose energy by interacting with CMB photons by producing a neutral pion:
\be
p+\gamma_{\mathrm{CMB}} \rightarrow p+\pi_0.
\ee
The proton energy at which this process can occur is called the GZK cutoff. 
Estimate the GZK cutoff energy.
The energy of CMB photons is $10^{-13}$ GeV (which follows from the measurement of CMB temperature of about 2.7 K).
Use 0.1 GeV for the mass of the pion and 1 GeV for the mass of the proton
