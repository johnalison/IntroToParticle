\begin{itemize}
\item[a)]{
The muon was the first elementary particle discovered that does not appear in ordinary atoms.
Negative muons can, however, form muonic atoms by replacing an electron in ordinary atoms. 
Estimate the size of muonic hydrogen in GeV.  }

\item[b)]{
Positronium is a system consisting of an electron and its anti-particle, a positron, bound together into an exotic atom.
Estimate the size of positronium in GeV.

\item[c)]{
Calculate the ratio of the size muonic hydrogen to hydrogen and of positronium to hydrogen.
