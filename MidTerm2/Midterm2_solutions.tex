\textbf{2) Why do the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions look so different despite the fact that at short distances they are all described by similar Feynman diagrams with similar coupling constants?} \hfill \textit{(2 points)}\\

\bc
Weak force has massive force carriers.\\
Strong force has a coupling the gets stronger at large distances

\textbf{3) Di-boson physics:  } \hfill \textit{(6 points)}\\
Processes in which pairs of gauge bosons are produced are a sensitive probe of the electro-weak theory. These are typically studied at the LHC by looking for signatures involving electrons or muons.  
Estimate how often a $WZ$ event decays into an electron or muon and three neutrinos.\\ ie: $e\nu\nu\nu$ or $\mu\nu\nu\nu$

\bc
$W \rightarrow \ell\nu$ (where $\ell$ is $\mu$ or $e$) is $\frac{2}{3+3\times 2} = \frac{2}{9}$ \\
$Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$  is $\frac{3}{3+3+3\times 5} = \frac{3}{21}$ \\
So, $WZ \rightarrow \ell\nu\nu\nu$ (where $\ell$ is $\mu$ or $e$) is $\frac{2}{9} \times \frac{3}{21} = \frac{2}{63} \sim 3\%$
\ec

\vspace{0.5in}

\textbf{4) Higgs Boson discovery: } \hfill \textit{(5 points)}\\
The Higgs boson was discovered in its decays to $WW (Br\sim20\%)$, $ZZ\ (Br\sim3\%)$ and $\gamma\gamma\ (Br\sim0.2\%)$.
However for the $WW$ and $ZZ$ decays, only the ``fully-leptonic'' channels -- where each boson decays leptonicically to $e$ or $\mu$ -- were used. \\

Estimate how often $WW \rightarrow \ell\nu\ell'\nu'$ and $ZZ\rightarrow\ell\ell\ell'\ell'$, where $\ell$ is e or $\mu$. (ignore decays through taus)\\

\bc
$W \rightarrow \ell\nu$ (where $\ell$ is $\mu$ or $e$) is $\frac{2}{3+3\times 2} = \frac{2}{9}$ \\
$Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$  (where $\ell$ is $\mu$ or $e$) is $\frac{2}{3+3+3\times 5} = \frac{2}{21}$ \\
So $WW\rightarrow \ell\nu\ell'\nu' = \frac{2}{9}\times\frac{2}{9} = \frac{4}{81} \sim 5\%$ \\
And $ZZ\rightarrow \ell\ell\ell'\ell = \frac{2}{21}\times\frac{2}{21} = \frac{4}{441} \sim 1\%$
\ec

Including these factors, rank the Higgs boson discovery channels by how many signal events they are expected to have.

\bc
$H\rightarrow WW \rightarrow \ell\nu\ell'\nu' = 0.2(H\rightarrow WW) \times 0.05 (WW\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell'\nu') \sim 1\%$\\
$H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma = 0.2\% $\\
$H\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow\ell\ell\ell'\ell' = 0.03 (H\rightarrow ZZ) \times 0.01 (ZZ\rightarrow\ell\ell\ell'\ell') \sim 0.03\%  $

\textbf{6) Electron-positron Collisions } \hfill \textit{(6 points)}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)]{
How does the value of $R(E_{CM}) \equiv \sigma(ee\rightarrow \rmt{jets})/\sigma(ee\rightarrow \mu\mu)$ change as $E_{CM}$ is increased beyond twice the mass of the charm quark? 
What values of $R(< 2 m_{\rmt{charm}})$ and $R(> 2 m_{\rmt{charm}})$ do you expect?
\bc
Before charm production,  the allowed ``jets'' are  $uu$ (with charge +2/3), dd and ss with charge (-1/3) all have a factor of 3 for color\\
So $R(< 2 m_{\rmt{charm}}) = 3\times \sum Q^2 = 3 \times \left( (\frac{2}{3})^2 + (\frac{-1}{3})^2  + (\frac{-1}{3})^2  \right) = 3 \times \frac{6}{9} = 2 $ \\
With charm production,  there is an additional allowed ``jets'' with  $cc$ (with charge +2/3) and a factor of 3 for color\\
So $R(> 2 m_{\rmt{charm}}) = 3\times \sum Q^2 = 3 \times \left( (\frac{2}{3})^2 + (\frac{-1}{3})^2  + (\frac{-1}{3})^2 + ( \frac{2}{3})^2 \right) = 3 \times \frac{10}{9} \sim 3 $

\textbf{8) Calorimeters } \hfill \textit{(4 points)}\\
Which are more challenging to accurately measure and why : Hadronic showers or electro-magnetic showers? 

Hadronic showers
\bi
\item[-] More complicated:  Multiple lengths scales interaction and radiation lengths important
\item[-] Less particles:  hadrons are heavier so you get less per unit input energy
\item[-] Longer: require more material to contain.

\textbf{9) For a new particle X with mass $\sim$ 2 TeV,  would you expect to measure the X mass more precisely from $X\rightarrow ee$ or $X \rightarrow \mu\mu$ ? Justify your answer.} \hfill \textit{(3 points)}\\

X$\rightarrow$ ee
\bi
\item[-] Electrons energies are measured in the calorimeter, which gets more accurate at high energies
\item[-] Muons energies are measured in the trackers (inner and muon), which gets less accurate at high energies

\item[b)]{ Why is Higgs boson production so much rarer then W or Z production despite the fact that their masses are similar?   
\bc
Small couplings to stuff inside the proton (which is light), need 2nd order diagrams with large coupling to top, Ws and Z.

\textbf{12) Higgs-Lepton interactions } \hfill \textit{(4 points)}\\
The coupling of the Higgs field to leptons can be studied by looking for detector signals where the Higgs boson decays to pairs leptons.

\bc
Higgs to $\tau\tau$ as it has the largest mass and the Higgs coupling scales with mass.
