\underline{\underline{Bonus}}  

Clarification from last time ... 

used ``obvious'' expansion about $\phi_1 = v$ and $\phi_2 = 0$

\be
\phi = (v + \eta + i \epsilon)
\ee

Put this into L and got 
\be
L' = \frac{1}{2}(\partial \epsilon)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial \eta)^2 - v^2\lambda\eta^2 + \frac{1}{2}e^2v^2A^2 - evA_\mu\partial^\mu\epsilon - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \rmt{(interactions)}
\ee

then we said that this looked like there was unphysical Dof and we starter over with 
\be
\phi = (v+h) e^{i\theta/v}
\ee

A (potentially) cleaner way to see whats happening is to notice 

\be
\frac{1}{2} (\partial \epsilon)^2 + ev A_\mu \partial^\mu \epsilon + \frac{1}{2}e v^2 A^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[ A_\mu + \frac{1}{ev} \partial_\mu \epsilon \right]^2
\ee

Now I can pick a gauge where 

\be
A_\mu \rightarrow A_\mu = \frac{1}{ev} \partial_\mu \epsilon
\ee

$\Rightarrow$ I only have the $\frac{1}{2}e^2v^2A^2$ term.

(of course this is all equivalent as above)

\textbf{\underline{\underline{Electroweak Unification}}}

Now that we have seen how we can use the Higgs Mechanism to generate masses for gauge bosons, we will see it works in the SM.

We will take the $L_{SM}$ with 3 massless spin-1 bosons and add a scalar (Higgs) w/the ``Mexican hat'' potential $\mu^2 < 0 $.

So we first need to talk about the initial $L_{SM}$ w/o the Higgs. 

This will lead us to talk about the Weak interaction group and ``Electroweak'' unification. 
(Major step forward in physics) 

\textbf{\underline{\underline{QED}} (EM)}

Gauge invariance led us to the $L_{QED}$

\be
\psi_e(x) \rightarrow e^{iq\alpha(x)} \psi_e(x)
\ee
for arbitrary $\alpha(x)$ which is function of spacetime.

We say that this is a ``local U(1) phase transformation'' (a number is a generator of U(1))

What will it take to make physics invariant under this transformation ?

Couple way to think about this.

Lets see what to the equations of motion (here the dirac equation)

\be
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi_e = 0 \rightarrow (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) e^{iq\alpha(x)} \psi_e = (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - q\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \alpha - m) e^{iq\alpha(x)} \psi_e = 0
\ee

or 
\be
i\gamma^\mu \left[ (\partial_\mu + iq \partial_\mu \alpha) - m \right] \psi_e = 0
\ee
Which is not the Dirac Eq!

$\Rightarrow$ the free particle Dirac Equation does not posess local U(1) invariance. 
We have shown h that its not possible for a free theory (one with out interactions).

We need something to cancel the $iq\partial_\mu\alpha$ term.

So lets add a term

\be
iqA_\mu \rightarrow iqA_\mu - iq\partial_\mu\alpha
\ee

or 
\be
A_\mu \rightarrow A_\mu - \partial_\mu\alpha
\ee

So the new ``Dirac Eq'' (really the D.E. with an interaction to a gauge boson) is 
\be
i\gamma^\mu \left[ (\partial_\mu + iq A_\mu ) - m \right] \psi_e = 0
\ee
This is invariant under $\psi \rightarrow e^{iq\alpha(x)} \psi$. 
The derivitive term brings down a piece that is exactly canceled by the $A_\mu$ transformation.

This of $(\partial_\mu + iq A_\mu )$ as a ``fancy'' derivitive $D_\mu = (\partial_\mu + iq A_\mu )$ then goet back the same for as the Dirac Eq with $\partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu$


\be
(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu  - m ) \psi = 0
\ee
Similarly the L that gives the Dirac equation is modified by $\partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu$.

This was all for a U(1) symmetry (phase symmetry).

This describes EM.  

In a world with out the weak interaction this would be quantum electrodynamics (QED).
